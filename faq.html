         <p>Here you'll find some frequently asked questions about our hotel. 
            We hope that you find it interesting and informative. These are the questions 
            that people call our front desk with most often.</p>

      <article id="primary">
         <p class="question">Why is the hotel theme after Pokémon?</p>
         <p class="answer">Our founder and C.E.O. of the hotel grow up playing the original game. Now as an adult he deemed it fit to theme his prized hotel after something he loved. The color scheme is modeled after the original Yellow, Blue, Red, Gold, and Silver games.</p>
         <p class="question">What are the check-in and check-out times?</p>
         <p class="answer">Check-out time is 11am and check-in is between 1 and 5pm. Speak to the front desk staff if you have special circumstances.</p>
         <p class="question">In addition to your accommodations, what other services do you offer?</p>
         <p class="answer">The Pokémon Center is the perfect place for a romantic getaway, a fully
            catered business meeting, or an event as special as a wedding. We do offer great room
            service food as well as a full service spa, both of which help our guests feel like they've
            come to the right place to get away from it all. </p>
         <p class="question">Do you have a pool?</p>
         <p class="answer">Like all hotels we too have a pool, but ours is actually quite unique. You'll just have to see it to believe it.</p>
         <p class="question">Do you accept AAA discounts, or other discount cards?</p>
         <p class="answer">No we don't accept any discount cards, but that doesn't mean 
            we don't have discount prices on our rooms. We do offer different kinds 
            of specials, some seasonal, some for senior, just for returning guests, etc. Visit 
            the events page on this Web site to see if any special discounts are currently 
            in effect, or just call our reservations desk.</p>
