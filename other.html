<h1>Pedro Correa's Travels</h1>
<p>This past summer I had the opportunity to travel to Mexico. I was very excited and was able to site see and be the usual annoying tourist.</p>
<p>In my time there I visited a few of the many large cities in the country.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Zacatecas, Zacatecas, Mexico</dt>
<dd>Known for their silver export.</dd>
<dt>Santiago de Queretaro, Queretaro, Mexico</dt>
<dd>Knowm for its 1200 meter long aqueduct.</dd>
<dt>Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico</dt>
<dd>Which I will know them for their food!</dd>
</dl>
<p>Here a few pictures from my travels there.</p>

<h2>Zacatecas</h2>
<p>I spent about four days in this city, site seeing and eating(most importantly). The city is known for its major silver export which I had the opportunity to see the mine. La Mina del Eden, which is beautiful. Located in the northern part of the city. I also had the chance to visit the cathedral in the downtown. The Cathedral of Our Lady of Assumption was beautiful, it was a shame that a phone cannot capture its beauty to its entirety. I was able to go inside and see the cathedral.</p>

<h2>Santiago de Queretaro</h2>
<p>I came to Santiago with the goal of see the aqueduct. It is hard to miss since it runs through the center of the city. Another very import thing I came to the city was to try the chiles. The <i>chiles rellenos</i> here were unbelievable! I love Mexican food and man was I eating some of the best foods!</p>

<h2>Guadalajara</h2>
<p>While I was here I was told you had to try the <i>torta ahogadas</i>, oh man I was not disappointed! I came to visit family in this city but my real goal was to eat good food. So that is what I did, I ate tortas and all the pan dulces I could handle(might I say was a lot). While in this city I visited the world known downtown, San Juan de Dios. This market area is full of commerce and food. One of the things I remember locals saying was, "There isn't a thing you can't find in San Juan". From what I saw, that is true no doubt about it.</p>
